Tutorial for GitHub/BIMM 143 project 2 files


Project2C_Draft.rmd and .nb.html are files of my project 2C draft. The rmd file is directly from the R markdown notebook, while the .html file was converted for more convient uploading elsewhere. 

The cinera.fasta file is a fasta file for amine oxidase for the Coprinopsis cinerea fungi, while the tuberoxidase and melanooxidase are two seperate fasta files for the same amine oxidase function, that were used to undergo pairwaise sequence alignment.

My scientific question is: Are there any shared gene homologs that code for taste and flavor between common edible mushrooms (such as the white button, shiitake, etc ), and the black perigord truffle (Tuber Melansporum)?

My hypotheis for this project is: If the black perigord truffle and common edible mushrooms share genetic and protien homologs that give their signautre aroma and taste profiles, then they can be used to share metabolic insight between the two, and be maniuplated to share eachothers flavor and aroma profiles.
